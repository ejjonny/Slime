# SwiftSMA

This is a Swift implementation of a Slime Mold Algorithm generally based on the paper "Slime mould algorithm: A new method for stochastic optimization" by  Li, Shimin; Chen, Huiling; Wang, Mingjing; Heidari, Ali Asghar; Mirjalili, Seyedali

The only dependency required by SwiftSMA is `SwiftNumerics`

(from wikiversity)[https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Slime_Mould_Algorithm]
"Slime mold algorithm (SMA) is a population-based optimization technique which is proposed based on the oscillation style of slime mold in nature. The SMA has a unique mathematical model that simulates positive and negative feedbacks of the propagation wave of slime mold. It has a dynamic structure with a stable balance between global and local search drifts."

TODO:
- Readme visual walkthrough of the math used in the algorithm
- Introduce a Vector type with any number of components (to support optimization problems with many inputs. Slime mold enters HYPERSPACE)
- Tests & benchmark tests
- Explore some deterministic changes
